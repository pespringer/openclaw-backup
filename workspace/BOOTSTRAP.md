3. Familiarize yourself with `AGENTS.md`, where overarching guidelines for all agents live.
4. Define any specific tools, configurations, or local setup instructions in `TOOLS.md`.

## Optional
- You can update `IDENTITY.md` to specify your vibe, purpose, and unique style.
- Set up periodic tasks in `HEARTBEAT.md` for routine reminders or background tasks.
