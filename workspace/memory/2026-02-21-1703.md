[Sat 2026-02-21 17:02 UTC] Why do you think you are using gpt-5.2? I show you using qwen3.5:cloud.
assistant: I’m not guessing—I pulled it from OpenClaw’s own runtime status for **this session** (`session_status`), which reported:

- **Model:** `openai-codex/gpt-5.2`

If you’re seeing `qwen3.5:cloud`, a few common explanations:

1) **You’re looking at a different session/agent**  
   OpenClaw can run multiple sessions (main + sub-agents/crons). Another session could be configured to use Qwen while this one uses GPT-5.2.

2) **You’re looking at a router/UI label, not the active session model**  
   Some dashboards show the *configured default* (or a provider route) rather than what the currently-running session is actually bound to.

3) **A model override/fallback is happening somewhere**  
   E.g., your gateway/app may be set to prefer Qwen, but this session has an explicit override to GPT-5.2 (or vice-versa).

To reconcile it quickly: where exactly do you “show” `qwen3.5:cloud` (screenshot or the command/output)? If it’s from the CLI, paste the output of `openclaw status` (or whatever screen you’re using) and I’ll tell you which value corresponds to the actual active model vs a configured default.
