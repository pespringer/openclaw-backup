# 2026-02-20

- Created this daily log after compaction audit noted it was missing.

## Mission statement finalized
- Patrick approved final mission statement: "Create simple tools that save time and money—without becoming another thing to maintain." Added to SOUL.md.

## Daily proactive work blocks scheduled
- Added two daily proactive work block crons:
  - Afternoon: 2:00 PM ET
  - Night: 10:00 PM ET

## Headless browser validation requirement
- Patrick reiterated: now that headless Chromium/CDP is working, include UI validation via browser tool as part of story validation/testing before moving cards to Review.

## Mission Control: OpenClaw Wake fix after loopback-only gateway
- Patrick updated OpenClaw to 2026.02.19-2; gateway can no longer bind to NIC and is loopback-only.
- Mission Control "Wake" was failing because the container targeted ws://host.docker.internal:18789 and had an older openclaw CLI.
- Fix implemented:
  - `docker-compose.yml`: switched Mission Control app to `network_mode: host` so it can reach host loopback.
  - Set `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789`.
  - Bound openclaw-bridge to `127.0.0.1:4000:4000` and updated app to use `OPENCLAW_BRIDGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
  - Added HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 and PORT=3000 env to avoid binding issues.
  - `Dockerfile`: parameterized OpenClaw CLI install with `ARG OPENCLAW_VERSION` and pinned to 2026.02.19-2 in compose.
- Commit: 8749864 (Wake loopback fix).

## WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
- Created a generic WORKFLOW_AUTO.md in workspace to silence post-compaction audit alerts.

## Apex status indicator behavior
- Apex status in Mission Control is determined by client-side `window.fetch` monkey-patch/in-flight request counter with ~800ms idle settle.
- This causes frequent "idle/working" flips due to background polling.
