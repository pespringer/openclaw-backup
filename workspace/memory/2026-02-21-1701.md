## Conversation Summary

assistant: Understood. I will maintain focus on completing the story **"AI: Task prioritization and risk estimation"** currently marked as in progress. Updates and work will strictly align with progressing and completing this task efficiently. Let me know if any priorities change.

What is the ETA on completion of this card?
assistant: Based on the details of **"AI: Task prioritization and risk estimation"**, here’s an estimated timeline for completion:

1. **Review and Planning (1-2 hours)**:
   - Analyze existing data structures and task dependencies.
   - Define the scope of AI-driven prioritization and risk estimation features.
   - Select and configure an appropriate AI model if external computation is required.

2. **Implementation (6-8 hours)**:
   - Extend the backend to support priority and risk calculation.
   - Integrate AI and historical data analysis into the system.
   - Implement and test UI for displaying priority/risk scores.

3. **Validation and Deployment (2-3 hours)**:
   - Test functionality against a set of sample tasks and edge cases.
   - Build, deploy, and validate in the production environment.

With focused work (~10-13 hours total), the card could be completed within 1-2 days, assuming no external blockers. If you'd like to prioritize specific aspects, let me know!

Would the open story get done quicker if we broke it up across multiple agents?
assistant: Yes—*if* we split it into cleanly-separated chunks. Otherwise, multiple agents can actually slow it down due to coordination, overlapping edits, and integration bugs.

### When multiple agents will speed this up
It’s faster if each agent owns a boundary like:
- **Agent A (Backend/data):** decide what “priority” + “risk” fields look like, where they’re stored (DB vs computed), and implement API changes.
- **Agent B (Scoring logic):** implement the initial heuristic scoring (due date, overdue, status, assigned, age, etc.) and write tests.
- **Agent C (UI):** display priority/risk on the board + sorting/filtering + any small UX polish.

This works because they can work in parallel with minimal file overlap.

### When it won’t
- If the story is still vague (no definition of “risk” / “priority” output).
- If multiple agents touch `app/projects/page.tsx` and the same API routes at the same time (merge conflicts + subtle regressions).
- If we don’t have an agreed “v1” scope (agents build different versions of the feature).

### My recommendation
Break the card into **2–3 sub-stories** on the board (Backend, Scoring, UI). Then we can run 2–3 agents in parallel and I’ll integrate.

If you want, tell me “go multi-agent,” and I’ll propose the exact sub-story breakdown (with acceptance criteria) and start delegating immediately.

go multi-agent
assistant: Spun up a 3-agent “parallel army” to finish **AI: Task prioritization and risk estimation** faster.

They’re running **in parallel** in isolated git worktrees/branches to avoid merge conflicts:

- **Backend/API agent** → `/home/claw/repos/mission-control-worktrees/ai-priority-backend` (branch `feat/ai-priority-backend`)  
  Adds `priorityScore` / `riskScore` (heuristic) to the tasks API response (no UI edits).

- **Scoring/algorithm agent** → `/home/claw/repos/mission-control-worktrees/ai-priority-scoring` (branch `feat/ai-priority-scoring`)  
  Builds a reusable scoring module (heuristic v1) with documented formula.

- **UI agent** → `/home/claw/repos/mission-control-worktrees/ai-priority-ui` (branch `feat/ai-priority-ui`)  
  Displays priority/risk on the Projects board + adds sort-by-priority (graceful fallback if fields missing).

Next step after they finish: I’ll merge/integrate the branches, run a full build, redeploy containers, then move the story to **Review**.

Sounds good. Please make sure they are using the openai-codex 5.2 model
assistant: Done — I killed and restarted all three Codex runs **explicitly pinned to the 5.2 Codex model** using:

`-m gpt-5.2-codex`

They’re now running as:

- scoring: session **nimble-claw**

Please make the gpt-5.2-codex the default model.
assistant: Set.

I updated `~/.codex/config.toml` to make **gpt-5.2-codex** the default:

```toml
model = "gpt-5.2-codex"
```

Verified by running `codex exec ...` with **no `-m` flag** and it reports `model: gpt-5.2-codex`.
