- Patrick preference: all projects should live under `~/repos/` (Mission Control at `~/repos/mission-control`).
- Patrick preference/workflow: for coding tasks, use Mission Control Project board (create card → In Progress when starting → Done when finished).
- Patrick workflow detail: when I finish work on a Projects-board card, move it to Review and tell him so he knows it's ready to validate.
