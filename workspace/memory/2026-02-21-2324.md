## Conversation Summary

user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):

  "sender": "8445509532"
}
```

I have restarted the gateway. Please try again.
assistant: The restart doesn’t seem to have re-enabled subagent spawning permissions. Subagents are still restricted to the **main** session only, and no other agent IDs are allowed.

Would you like me to investigate further, or should I begin working on the LLM storage story directly in this session? Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

```

can you update the openclaw.json in ~/.openclaw to allow the session_spawn for all agents and models?

can you update the openclaw.json in ~/.openclaw to allow the session_spawn for all agents and models?
assistant: The `openclaw.json` file currently does not specify explicit permissions for `sessions_spawn`, but it seems configured to limit subagent capabilities indirectly.

I'll update the file to clearly enable `sessions_spawn` for all agents and models by explicitly setting the permissions in the `agents` section. After the change, I'll prompt the gateway restart for the updated configuration to take effect.

Let me proceed with the modification.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "1712",
  "sender": "8445509532"
}
```

That change did not fix the issue. The gateway failed to restart. Below is the error. I've also included a link to the documentation. https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started Config invalid File: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json Problem: - agents.defaults.subagents: Unrecognized keys: "allowedAgents", "allowedModels"
assistant: It seems that my attempt to expand permissions for `sessions_spawn` included invalid keys (`allowedAgents` and `allowedModels`) in the `openclaw.json` configuration. I appreciate you sharing the documentation link—I'll refer to it and ensure the update adheres to the correct structure.

Let me revisit and adjust the configuration to properly enable subagents for all models and agents. I'll fix this and ensure the gateway restarts successfully.

}
```

You broke the gateway again. Please look at the documentation to see how to fix this. Config invalid File: ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json Problem: - agents: Unrecognized key: "subagents"
assistant: Thank you for pointing that out. It seems "subagents" is not a valid configuration key under "agents" in the OpenClaw configuration. I'll refer to the documentation to identify the correct way to specify subagent-related permissions.

Let me review the docs and correct this immediately.
assistant: The fetched content from the documentation link is partial, and it does not provide the specific information I need regarding configuration keys for managing subagent permissions. It seems further exploration of the documentation sections (particularly configuration or permissions settings) is required.

Could you provide the specific section of the documentation, or should I explore additional documentation for detailed instructions on correctly enabling subagent usage? Let me know!
user: System: [2026-02-21 23:14:28 UTC] ⚠️ Post-Compaction Audit: The following required startup files were not read after context reset:
  - WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
  - memory\/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md

Please read them now using the Read tool before continuing. This ensures your operating protocols are restored after memory compaction.

```

That is the only documentation I have. The only other information I have is this: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/tree/main
assistant: The web-fetch response for the GitHub link doesn't provide detailed configuration insights either. Would you like me to explore or directly troubleshoot by recommending how to test subagents locally, verify changes, or diagnose other workarounds like alternate external GitHub options?

```

Does that help?
assistant: The required files (`WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` and `memory/2026-02-21.md`) have been reviewed, and I’ve reloaded the relevant workflows and memory notes.

Key highlights:
1. **Operating Workflow:** Refers to the Mission Control board tasks and specific steps (e.g., `docker compose` for task validations).
2. **Recent Memory (February 21, 2026):**
   - Morning brief fixes addressed Brave Search API rate-limit issues and weather fetch unreliability.
   - Updated prompts for accurate execution via `curl`.
   - Noted Codex’s prompt-quoting issues and suggested mitigations.

If I need to revise any specific handling in light of this context or restart subagent-related workflows, please let me know!
