- Mission Control: Implemented Wake control for OpenClaw; wake now works with gateway bind=lan (0.0.0.0) and token auth.
- Attempted to tighten bind to docker bridge using gateway bind=custom + customBindHost=172.17.0.1; OpenClaw 2026.2.13 config validator rejected key `gateway.customBindHost` as unrecognized, so we left bind=lan.
- Patrick is OK leaving it as-is short term (behind Ubiquiti firewall, no direct internet exposure). Reminder requested: in 1–2 days, ask if he wants to revisit security hardening for gateway exposure.
- Patrick is installing headless Chrome/Chromium on the Ubuntu host (no GUI). Follow up tomorrow evening to see if we can set up OpenClaw browser CDP (remote debugging) access for UI automation.
