## Updates on Subagents and Configuration Issues
- Patrick attempted to implement my earlier suggested configuration file changes to enable subagent spawning, but the configuration validation failed with an error indicating that the "channelPolicies" key was invalid. This revealed that I misunderstood the valid schema for the `openclaw.json` file.
- Patrick shared the OpenClaw GitHub repo link (https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for further analysis.
  - I attempted to fetch schema or configuration documentation but encountered missing or inaccessible files both locally and online.
  - Next steps include consulting the OpenClaw documentation (https://docs.openclaw.ai) or community (Discord: https://discord.gg/clawd) for authoritative guidance on enabling subagent spawning.

## Progress on LLM Integration Task
- Continued work on "Feature: LLM prompt storage and generation integration."
- Progress focused on:
  - Completing API endpoints to support prompt storage/retrieval in the Mission Control task database.
  - Backend testing and refinement to ensure API readiness for frontend integration.
- Encountered no blockers for continued progress on this feature.
