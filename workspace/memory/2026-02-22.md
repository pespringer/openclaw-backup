## Status Update
- Patrick identified the issue with the missing story, `d132c9b4-eeb2-49d9-a673-ca86cad90b7d`, being related to a mismatch in `status` field casing between "In Progress" and "in-progress." He updated the database to correct the inconsistency, ensuring existing and future stories align to use "in-progress" as the status value.
- The LLM prompt storage feature work continued, focusing on database schema design, API functionality for prompt storage/retrieval, and LLM integration into Mission Control.
- Browser functionality was attempted for UI analysis but encountered issues with browser tooling via the headless Chromium service. This did not impact further backend development on the current story.
