## Mission Control work
- Reconnected browser control to the Mission Control UI using the Chromium headless service setup on February 21.
- Debugged why the story "Feature: LLM prompt storage and generation integration" wasn't visible on the board.
  - Verified the new task was inserted correctly into the Postgres database and marked as "In Progress."
  - Found that the app correctly queries the database but did not update the UI.
- Attempted API access but encountered authentication issues.
  - Patrick provided API/UI credentials: 
    - **Email**: apex@missioncontrol.app 
    - **Password**: ApexM1ss1on!
  - Saved these securely in memory for future use.

## Issues encountered
- Browser service configuration relied on Chromium headless service to navigate UI but may require restart; unable to fully interact with the running web application.
- To proceed with feature implementation and keep tasks visible, used direct database insertion to add task to \"Task\" table. However, it was still not reflected on the web interface.
