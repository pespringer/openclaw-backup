## Mission Control project board workflow (via Postgres in Docker)
- Project board tasks live in Postgres running in Docker Compose for `~/repos/mission-control`.
- Connect/query via:
  ```bash
  docker exec mission-control-db psql -U mission -d mission_control -c "<SQL>"
  ```
- Board workflow conventions:
  - When no tasks are in progress, pick the next story from **Backlog**.
  - Once a story is picked up, start work immediately (no confirmation).
  - Move to **Review** when ready; Patrick manually validates and then instructs when to move to **Done**.
  - The story description/details are the definitive instructions for board work.

## Operational constraints / process
- Browser environment is not set up for the agent (no browser automation/UI login from agent).
- When changes affect something running in Docker (Mission Control), run:
  - `docker compose down`
  - `docker compose up -d --build`
  so containers are rebuilt and ready for review.
- When a change is ready for review, commit completed work to the local git repo.

## Work completed (high level)
- Implemented per-task activity/audit trail:
  - API `GET /api/tasks/[id]/activity` (filters `ActivityEvent` by `metadata.taskId`).
  - UI shows Activity timeline in task edit modal.
  - More specific log events on task updates: status/due/assignee/content edits.
  - Generated test `ActivityEvent` rows for review.
- Implemented notifications/reminders:
  - Dashboard alert surfaces for overdue tasks and tasks in Review.
  - Optional daily OpenClaw cron summary (via openclaw-bridge): added `POST` support to bridge `/cron/jobs` and added UI trigger in Settings.
  - Updated docker-compose to mount cron dir writable for bridge.
- Implemented Projects search + filters:
  - Added filters for status/assignee/overdue/due-in-N-days.
  - Added search across title/description/comments via new API `GET /api/tasks/search?q=...`.

## QMD memory backend request
- Patrick asked to enable the QMD memory backend (docs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/memory#qmd-backend-experimental).
- Found `qmd` and `bun` are currently missing on host; enabling QMD requires installing them and setting `memory.backend = "qmd"` in `/home/claw/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (then restarting gateway). Pending user confirmation.

## Process reminder (Patrick)
- Patrick explicitly reminded: follow the proper process so stories are worked in a timely fashion.
- When a story is moved to **In Progress**, begin implementation immediately and keep momentum through commit + rebuild + move to Review.

## Morning brief behavior
- If the Morning Brief hits a web_search rate limit, wait a few minutes and retry (instead of failing immediately).

## Morning brief: project priorities source
- Morning Brief project info/priorities should come from Mission Control projects/tasks (Postgres-backed board), not PROJECT_BOARD.md.

## Mission Control workflow update
- Now that headless Chromium/CDP + OpenClaw browser tool is working, Patrick wants UI validation as part of story testing/validation before moving cards to Review.
