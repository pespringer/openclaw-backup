## Mission Control work
- Created backlog stories in local Mission Control board (11 items) and added a bug story: due date displays previous day (timezone/date-only handling).
- Implemented **Global Apex status indicator**:
  - Initially added a separate global header; Patrick disliked it (duplicate “Mission Control”, menu UX issues).
  - Adjusted to integrate `ApexStatusIndicator` into existing page headers/top bars across routes instead of a separate header.
  - Moved indicator position on dashboard to be left of the Search button.
  - Marked story **Done**.
- Added setup documentation:
  - Created `SETUP.md` with Docker/local dev/env/Prisma/troubleshooting.
  - Updated `README.md` to point to `SETUP.md`.
- Implemented **Homepage: Projects snapshot cards**:
  - Added API `GET /api/dashboard/summary` returning counts (open/backlog/in-progress/review/done), overdue count, done last 24h/7d, admin scope.
  - Added summary cards to home page.
  - Marked story **Done**.
- Implemented **Projects board: overdue & due-soon highlighting**:
  - Visual highlight for overdue (red) and due soon within 48h (amber) with badges.
  - Uses a `nowMs` state ticking every minute to avoid calling `Date.now()` during render.
  - Moved story to **Review**.

## Ops / automation
- Morning brief delivery issue: brief was generated but not sent because it was treated as an internal queued announcement and suppressed with `NO_REPLY`. Manually sent brief afterward.
- Updated the **Daily 8am Morning Brief** cron job delivery to always announce to Patrick’s Telegram (`8445509532`) with best-effort delivery.

## Notes
- `gh` token on this box lacks `read:project`, so GitHub Project board queries fail unless refreshed with that scope.
